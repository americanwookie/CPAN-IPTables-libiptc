IPTables-libiptc version 0.02
=============================

The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
that should be provided before the module is installed.

A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the
README file from a module distribution so that people browsing the
archive can use it get an idea of the modules uses. It is usually a
good idea to provide version information here so that people can
decide whether fixes for the module are worth downloading.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/usr/local/stow/
   make
   sudo make test
   make install PREFIX=/usr/local/stow/stow/IPTables-libiptc-0.02

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

 iptables
 libiptc.a

 Currently depends on iptables/libiptc version 1.3.4, because this
 version contained a chain reference bug.  For this reason, it has
 been necessary to include it the module and compile libiptc.a our
 self, with this bug fixed.

 This has been fixed in 1.3.6 by me, but this module has not been
 updated yet.
