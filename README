IPTables-libiptc version 0.03
=============================

This package provides a Perl interface to the netfilter/iptables
C-library libiptc.

Advantages of this module: Many rule changes can be done very
fast. Several rule changes is committed atomically.

This module is heavily inspired by the CPAN module IPTables-IPv4.  The
CPAN module IPTables-IPv4 could not be used because it has not been
keept up-to-date, with the newest iptables extentions.  This is a
result of the module design, as it contains every extention and thus
needs to port them individually.

This package has another approach, it links with the systems libiptc.a
library and depend on dynamic loading of iptables extensions available
on the system.

This design limits us to only export the libiptc chain manipulation
functions.  All rule manipulations are done through the iptables.c
"do_command" function. (As iptables.c is not made as a library, the
package unfortunally needs to maintain/contain this C file).



INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/usr/local/stow/
   make
   sudo make test
   make install PREFIX=/usr/local/stow/stow/IPTables-libiptc-0.03

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

 iptables
 libiptc.a

 Currently depends on iptables/libiptc version 1.3.4, because this
 version contained a chain reference bug.  For this reason, it has
 been necessary to include it in the module and compile libiptc.a our
 self, with this bug fixed.

 This has been fixed in 1.3.6 by me, but this module has not been
 updated yet.
