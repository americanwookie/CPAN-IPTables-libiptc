* Auto detect iptables version.

* Include "interface.pm" perhaps under a different name.




* Make more test cases.

* Test cases, do a save and restore of original iptables ruleset, to
  avoid fucking-up users iptables rules.

* Update library to new iptables versions

  ** Do several releases to match the versions used by Debian

  ** There migth be issues with the latest release, as libiptc.c has
     been changed to a dynamic lib libiptc.so, which is the same name
     I used in Perl.
